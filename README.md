# PublicFileProvider

PublicFileProvider is a special subclass of [`ContentProvider`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentProvider.html) that facilitates exposing files associated with an app by creating a `content://` URI for a file instead of a `file:///` URI.

**WARNING:** Most of the time this is NOT what you want. Use [FileProvider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/FileProvider.html) to only grant temporary access to files, e.g. when [sharing](https://developer.android.com/training/secure-file-sharing/index.html) content to other apps.
 
PublicFileProvider is a modified version of FileProvider with the specific goal to expose files without using Android's URI permission mechanism. This can come in handy when you have to provide a `content://` URI but can't easily grant read access to whatever app ends up accessing the content.
One use case is a custom ringtone in a notification. Check out the blog post [Notifications, Sounds, Android 7.0, and Aggravation](https://commonsware.com/blog/2016/09/07/notifications-sounds-android-7p0-aggravation.html) for more details.

## Usage

Add a provider element to your Manifest:

```xml
<manifest>
    ...
    <application>
        ...
        <provider
            android:name="de.cketti.fileprovider.PublicFileProvider"
            android:authorities="com.mydomain.publicfileprovider"
            android:exported="true">
            
            <meta-data
                android:name="de.cketti.fileprovider.PUBLIC_FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
                android:resource="@xml/publicfileprovider_paths" />
        
        </provider>
        ...
    </application>
</manifest>
```

Create a file `res/xml/publicfileprovider_paths.xml` with the configuration, e.g.

```xml
<paths xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
    <files-path name="my_notification_sounds" path="notification_sounds/"/>
</paths>
```
The format of this file is identical to that of [FileProvider](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/content/FileProvider.html).

To get the `content://` URI for a file you want to expose to all apps on the device use the following code:

```java
File notificationSoundsPath = new File(Context.getFilesDir(), "notification_sounds");
File myNotificationSoundFile = new File(imagePath, "ding.ogg");
Uri contentUri = getUriForFile(getContext(), "com.mydomain.publicfileprovider", myNotificationSoundFile);
```
